# zeqqe's Text-to-Speech CLI

> An interactive command-line tool for text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis using both eSpeak and Piper TTS engines.

---

## Features

* **Dual Engine Support:** Switch seamlessly between the fast, robotic **eSpeak** engine and the realistic, neural **Piper TTS** engine.
* **Interactive CLI:** An easy-to-use command-line interface for controlling all features.
* **Advanced Speech Customization (eSpeak):** Adjust rate, pitch, amplitude, word gap, and select from various voice variants.
* **High-Quality Speech Synthesis (Piper):** Leverages a modern neural network model for natural, human-like speech.
* **Play & Save Functionality:** Speak text directly and simultaneously save the output to a timestamped `.wav` file with a single command.

## Dependencies & Setup

This script is designed to run in a **Linux or WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)** environment.
